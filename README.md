# ADR-Template
A custom item for recording architecturally significant decisions within Visual Studio.

The format follows Michael Nygard's proposal for [Architecture Decision Records](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). The template text is from this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41NVge3_cYo) and [slide deck](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2017_017_001_497746.pdf) of Micheal Keeling.

## Install the Item Template
Add [ADR-Template.md](./ADR-Template.md) to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\NewFileItems`.

Restart Visual Studio if you had it open.

The item is now listed in the __General Category__ of the __Add New Item__ dialog for a solution.
